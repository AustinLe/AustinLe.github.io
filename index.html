                <h2><b>1. Introduction</b></h2>
              <p>GraphSAGE proposes a framework that can identify the node's neighborhood's structural properties as well as 
                its role in the overall graph.[1] We can use GraphSAGE to utilizes node features to learn a general embedding 
                function that simultaneously encodes the node's neighborhood's structure and feature distribution.[1] Additionally, 
                GraphSAGE will be compared to graph convolutional neural networks on image data in the field of computer vision which 
                just special cases of graphs. GCN apply simple "convolutions" to graph data to learn predictive features from weighted 
                sums of progressively more complicated nonlinear relationships between nodes. GCNs share weights among nodes in a graph 
                to more easily learn their inherently uneven distribution. GraphSAGE allows GCN to be applied in an inductive, unsupervised 
                manner with trainable aggregation functions, which facilitates machine learning tasks on graphs that are not fixed and 
                necessarily evolve over time, such as social networks.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                In this paper, we are investigating the social network for individual NBA players
                and the relationship between each team.We will try to solve how to implement GraphSAGE to learn over the NBA players' 
                dataset and find a correlation between the NBA champions. We will then run this model across current NBA players and their 
                projected statistics to see which team is predicted to win. Since it’s hard to predict the current 2021 NBA season due to the 
                lack of data for us to use, we decided to predict the 2019-2020 season, we use our prediction to compare with the real result 
                in the end. Our dataset is suitable for our given application because its graph has sparse and high-dimensional but meaningful 
                connections that we can compress down to a low-dimensional embedding. Additional, we will also be performing graph classification. 
                The graph will have a total 120 data-point and it contains a set of node features. For each season we will have 30 data points 
                (represented 30 teams) and we decided to use 4 seasons in total to do our training model. Each node will be filled with players statistics 
                as individual data points. We will use the team name as our node. Each node will contain the players of that team, with edges between 
                players representing the amount of time they are on the court together. We will also label the data-point as 1,2,3,4,5: finals, conference, 
                semi, playoffs, none (shows how far the team can go in the NBA season). The vanilla GCN will help demonstrate the advantages 
                using more sophisticated graph convolutions approaches like GraphSAGE. 
                <br />
                <br />
                The final goal is to use team statistics or players’ statistics and analysis for predicting who wins games 
                (by leveraging the players statistics and team statistics from the 2015-2019 season to predict the winners of NBA games 
                for the 2019-2020 season). In order to have enough training data, we choose the data from the 2015-2019 season 
                (may use more data as we do the project) and since it’s hard to predict the future season (do not have enough data 
                for the current season) so we choose to predict the 2019-2020 season. We will also use data that we found to create edges 
                between players on a team so that they will be connected by how much playing time they play with one another.

                  <h2><b>3. Data Analysis</b></h2>
                <p>We spent lots of time on data scraping since the datasets we use are very complicated. It's  important for us to 
                  decided what features vectors should we use as players' and team's statistics. And we will use those features later on.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
  
                  When thinking of what makes an NBA Team great, we looked through different statistics and we settled with individual 
                  points-per-game, assists, rebounds, field goal percentage minutes and games played. The aggregated totals of each player 
                  on the team in conjunction with the amount of time played together would help us in determining how successful a team's 
                  network of players can be. This was our initial datasets where we collected individual player statistics and we had 
                  another with just the teams, a boolean value on whether or not they made the playoffs as well as how far they actually 
                  went in the playoffs. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  A main chunk of our project then revolved around cleaning and extracting the information that we wanted from a large 
                  play-by-play dataset that consisted of each and every NBA game in a  single season. Depending on the team network that 
                  had to be created, what we tried to do was to gather all the games that they participated in and analyzed at what time 
                  did players sub out for one another. By using python/pandas we were able to create an algorithm that would create an edge 
                  between every player in the lineup and adjust its weight according to the time in the game. Once we collected all edges 
                  from every game in the NBA season, we grouped the duplicate edges and summed them to get a total amount of playing time 
                  between each player on the team.  This would represent the edges between players that we needed to create each individual 
                  team's network.

                    <h4><b>4.1 GraphSAGE</b></h4>
                  <p>GraphSAGE that allow Mechine Learning methods to effectively utilize the graph data. With the GraphSAGE, 
                    it no longer needs to take extra time to train a new embedding for a graph seen only at run time that might need 
                    to be classified quickly. The GraphSAGE embedding learned from a large, representative training graph would be 
                    serviceable for the given task.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
    
                    We first will use GraphSAGE’s embedding algorithm to embedding the nodes,we import a graph G(V,E) and vector 
                    representations of node features Xv, ∀v∈V and  outputs  embeddingszvfor  every  node  in  the  graph.[1]  
                    For  our  graphclassification graph, we are using 30 nodes which represent the 30 NBA teamsas individual data 
                    point and each node will filled with players’ statistics.  Therewill be no edges between the nodes.  
                    For each node, it will contain 15 players ofthat team with players’ statistics as their features, and we will 
                    use the amountof time players are on the court together as edges to connect each player. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A main chunk of our project then revolved around cleaning and extracting the information that we wanted from a large 
                    play-by-play dataset that consisted of each and every NBA game in a  single season. Depending on the team network that 
                    had to be created, what we tried to do was to gather all the games that they participated in and analyzed at what time

                    team's network.

                    <br/>
                    As a result, based on the links for each player, the shortest 5 paths can be leveraged to find the closest 
                    relationship between those 5 players. And this will shows who are the main 5 players in that team.

                              <h4>A. Project Proposal</h4>
                            <p>For our project, We will investigate the social network for individual NBA players
                              and the relationship between each team. The goal of this project is to: use team statistics or players’ 
                              statistics and analysis for predicting who wins games (by leveraging the players statistics and team 
                              statistics from the 2015-2019 season to predict the winners of NBA games for the 2019-2020 season). 
                              In order to have enough training data, we choose the data from the 2015-2019 season (may use more data as 
                              we do the project) and since it’s hard to predict the future season (do not have enough data for the current 
                              season) so we choose to predict the 2019-2020 season.
                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              For our domain this quarter, we discussed graph analysis and learned methods such as GCN, node2vec, random 
                              walks and so on. For the first week we learned how to measure different kinds of centrality of the graph. 
                              For that, we can use the degree centrality to get the top player prediction as part of our project. 
                              A player’s node will generally gravitate as the “center” of it’s team because they are considered a team’s 
                              core that they will build around. This topic is interesting because we are not investigating the prediction 
                              of nodes and their labels, but rather creating a social network of our NBA players dataset. We will use this 
                              created network to compare against other teams and see what averages of our selected statistics indicate a 
                              more successful team. There have been other forms of prediction regarding NBA players and their standings, 
                              as well as betting, but none have utilized GCNs and Neural networks to produce their results. In the 
                              replication project, we are focused on passing information through a network and trying to predict labels 
                              based on these aggregated features. For our project we want to do sort of a reverse, where we construct a 
                              graph based on features from past seasons and use this network to learn over what aggregated features can 
                              help produce an NBA championship caliber team.

                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              For the methods that we attempt to solve the problem will be:
                              <br/>
                              1) GraphSAGE: we use players’ statistics and team's statistics from the 2015-2019 season and use those 
                              statistics to create a graph classification. The graph will have a total 120 datapoint and it contains a 
                              set of node features. For each season we will have 30 data points and we decided to use 4 seasons in total 
                              to do our training model. For player statistics we will use PPG, AST, TRB, MP, GP and so on. 30 teams will 
                              each be filled with players statistics as individual data points. We will use the team name as our node and 
                              there are no edges between each team. And for each node, it will contain the players of that team, edges between 
                              players will be the amount of time they are on the court together. We will also label the datapoint as 1,2,3,4,5: 
                              finals, conference, semi, playoffs, none. (shows how far the team can go in the nba season)
                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              2) GCN: Using previous nba seasons and the corresponding champion, we will use a GCN to learn over the nba 
                              players dataset and create a correlation between the nba champions. We will then run this model across the 
                              current NBA players and their projected stats to see which team is predicted to win.
                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              3) We believe an implementation that revolves around Label propagation will be useful when finding comparisons 
                              between different teams. Just as an overall goal, teams try to find special “unicorn” and “generational” 
                              talent for their team and add other players that would help compliment their playstyle. In terms of a 
                              graphical representation, we believe that we could use label propagation amongst teams to determine their 
                              neighborhood characteristics and use this to compare to previous successful teams. If they have similarities 
                              in makeup, we would see that they may have a shot at the title for the upcoming season.
                              <br/>
                              <br/>
                              We would like to produce a report style paper where we will analyze the nba datasets that we will scrape 
                              ourselves. We also want to provide visualizations of interesting findings about NBA teams and their 
                              characteristics that have separated them from the rest of the teams as winners. If we are not able to 
                              find some sort of standings at the end of the season, we will try to predict just one overall champion. 
                              Additionally for a stretch goal, we believe that creating some sort of website that will allow user 
                              interactions to pick certain players and teams and display their most important characteristics would be 
                              an interesting challenge!
